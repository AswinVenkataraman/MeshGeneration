# MeshGeneration
 Created mesh dynamically in unity. The mesh includes both floor and walls along with textures.
 
 This allows you to map points first and then when all the points are plotted, the wall and the floor meshes are generated.
 
 This system could be developed further for games that involves creating buildings dynamically.
